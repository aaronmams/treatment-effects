#Next we move on to analyzing the actual birthweight data from Cattaneo 2010

#IMPORTANT NOTE: In our example we pretended like older women were more likely to smoke during 
# pregnancy.  In the actual data it is the case that younger women are more likely to smoke 
# during pregnancy.

#we can see this by running a logistic regression to explain smoking status
# using age
summary(glm(factor(mbsmoke)~mage,data=df,family='binomial'))

#note the negative coefficient estimate on age indicating that older women
# were less likely to smoke during pregnancy

#Potentially observed mean (POM) is just derived by estimating a separate regression
# for the treatment group and control group.  Then take the entire sample and assign them
# to the treatment group and get the fitted value...do the same thing assigning everyone in 
# the sample to the control group.  If you think about it visually, what you have done is 
# created two different slopes (least squares lines through different clusters of the data).  For
# any particular age women you can intersect that x-value with the regression lines to get the 
# predicted birthweight if that women were a smoker and if that woman were a non-smoker.
